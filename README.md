# Task Eleven – JavaScript Hover Image Hide/Show

This project demonstrates a simple interactive behavior using **only JavaScript** (no CSS).

## 📋 Task Requirements

1. Create an `index.html` file.
2. Add an image element that uses a real image link from the internet.
3. When the mouse hovers over the image, it should disappear.
4. When the mouse leaves the image area, it should reappear.
5. No CSS should be used for the hover effect.
6. Upload the file to a folder named `taskeleven` in your GitHub repository.

## ✅ Technologies Used

- HTML5
- JavaScript (vanilla)
- No external libraries
- No CSS

## 📁 Folder Structure

taskeleven/
└── index.html

## 🔍 Live Behavior

- The image is visible by default.
- On hovering the image, it becomes invisible.
- When the mouse leaves the image area, it reappears.

## 🖼️ Image Source

The image used is from [Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:PNG_transparency_demonstration_1.png) and is publicly available.

## 💡 Bonus Challenge

Try doing the same task using **only CSS** with `:hover` and `visibility` or `opacity`.
